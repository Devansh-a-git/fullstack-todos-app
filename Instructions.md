The project requirements were quite comprehensive. Might have missed a part or two.
Was told to spend only 2-3 hours on it but took a little bit more time.
Only focused on functionality part, not the UI.
Have done some things extra than what was mentioned.

Frontend : - React js
** Have not focused on the design rather on functionality.**
Since it was communicated that it is gonna 70% frontend role have tried to showcase the basic required skills.

- drilling, context API, debouncing, reusable components, custom hooks

Backend : - Node.js - postgreSQL(cloud)
Since it was a smaller requirement, i have not used an ORM.
i have created a new free postgres instance using render, have given the complete creds for the same since it is not sensitive in case you may require to check the DB

**Commands to run the project on local : **

Backend -
node server.js

Frontend -
cd frontend
npm run dev

-Open browser  
visit - http://localhost:5173/
\*or any port that you have ran your frontend on.
