The packged and dependencies i have pushed to the repo just to keep it simpler.
The project requirements were quite comprehensive. Might have missed a part or two.
Was told to spend only 2-3 hours on it but took a little bit more time.
Only focused on functionality part, have some elements of a production grade app but not much since it is a prototype.
Have done some things extra than what was mentioned.



Frontend : - React js
  Have not focused on the design rather on functionality.
  Since it was communicated that it is gonna 70% frontend role have tried to showcase the basic required skills. 
  - drilling, react context API, debouncing, reusable components, custom hooks

Backend : - Node.js - cloud postgreSQL
  Since it was a smaller requirement, i have not used an ORM.
  i have created a new free postgres instance using render, have given the complete creds for the same since it is not sensitive in case you may require to check the DB



Commands to run the project on local : 

Backend - 
    node server.js

Frontend -
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    
-Open browser  
visit - http://localhost:5173/ 
*or any port that you have ran your frontend on.
